COASTERS: The market remained firmly in
the doldrums Monday with refinery tonnes
still said to be tight, apart from one cargo
reported to be available from North France.
There was, however, reported to be some
potential buying interest from petchems for
normal butane at CIF prices around naph-
tha parity.
ARA: According to sources Monday the
market opened the new working week on
a quiet note with some refinery product
said to be offer, but gasoline blending
demand was seen to be thin and there
were no reported trades. “Blenders have
disappeared from the market,” comment-
ed one player.
West Mediterranean
Propane
Industry sources Monday said there were
no major changes to the market with only
limited demand for propane exports from
Lavera apart from a small lot for Corsica
loading at the end of this week.
Butane
According to sources Monday an export
of 6,000 mt was currently loading at
Lavera, but there were no other reported
nominations for butane exports. Both
public selling interest and public buying
interest for spot Lavera product appeared
to be fairly muted.
Arab Gulf
Saudi Aramco has set its February
Contract Price for propane and butane at
$820/mt and $810/mt, respectively, a
source close to the Middle Eastern
exporter said Monday. The February
propane CP is down $115/mt from
January, while the butane CP is down
$110/mt. The February CPs for both
propane and butane were set at the lower
end of market expectations. Trade sources
that Platts spoke to late last week had
expected the February propane CP to be
pegged between $820/mt and $850/mt,
while the butane CP was expected to be at

between parity and a $5-10/mt discount to
propane. But one Japanese trader said
Monday that as Saudi Aramco was offering
a February-loading refrigerated propane
cargo at $815/mt last week, the CP was
not surprising.
Asia
REFRIGERATED: On the first day of the
Asian trading week participants were heard
to be reviewing their positions and pro-
grams for March arrival product, as Saudi
Aramco’s February Contract Prices,
announced Monday, were apparently at the
lower end of what was expected. “It’s just
the beginning of the week; CP has only
been announced. The way CP has been
set, traders now expect the market direc-
tion to change ... the [February/March]
contango will widen,” said a Japanese
importer. “Last week they [Saudi Aramco]
were trying to sell [early February loading]
propane at $815/mt, offered down to
$812-813/mt, but couldn’t sell, and they
have set [February propane] CP at
$820/mt. So, while it appears that the CP
has been set lower than market expecta-
tions, it’s not exactly low given the current
market fundamentals,” a Singapore-based
Japanese trader said. Meanwhile, amid
lackluster trading, a $12/mt rise in front-
month Brent futures led first-line CFR
propane prices to rise $7/mt to $851/mt,
while CFR butane values inched up $2/mt
to $841/mt from Friday. The contango for
February/March propane CP swaps
widened from minus $1/mt Friday to minus
$13/mt Monday.
Americas
Heavy natural gasoline prices increased
Monday, the first day of February pricing.
Civil unrest in Egypt continued to provide
support for surging crude oil prices, but
was unable to swing NGL prices. “Heavy
natural gasoline is more affected by liquid
price swings,” a refiner commented. Light-
end ethane prices slipped to 59.25
cents/gal, down over a penny from Friday.
Demand from the petrochemical sector
weakened, as market sources noted
some plant maintenance had eaten into
consumption. “Ethylene spot [pricing] had
been trading higher last week, and ethane
price is trading lower [today],” a petchem
producer said. Prior to the Platts Market
on Close assessment process, non-LDH
propane was heard talked at 134.25
cents/gal, non-LDH normal butane was
heard talked at 170.25 cents/gal, and
non-Targa natural gasoline was heard
talked at 220.25 cents/gal. March crude
was trading at $92.34/b. During the
Platts MOC process, there were four
trades at 219 cents/gal for February non-
Targa natural gasoline. DCP bought
25,000 barrels from Lukoil, Statoil bought
25,000 barrels from Lukoil, and Koch
bought 25,000 barrels from Lukoil.
ConocoPhillips bought 25,000 barrels
from Glencore. There were no trades for
normal butane or propane.
News
Saudi Aramco sets Feb propane CP at
$820/mt, down $115/mt from Jan
Saudi Aramco has set its February
Contract Price for propane and butane at
$820/mt and $810/mt, respectively, a
source close to the Middle Eastern
exporter said Monday. The February
propane CP is down $115/mt from
January, while the butane CP is down
$110/mt. The February CPs for both
propane and butane were set at the lower
end of market expectations. Trade sources
that Platts spoke to late last week had
expected the February propane CP to be
pegged between $820/mt and $850/mt,
while the butane CP was expected to be at
between parity and a $5-10/mt discount to
propane. But one Japanese trader said
Monday that as Saudi Aramco was offering
a February-loading refrigerated propane
cargo at $815/mt last week, the CP was
not surprising. Platts assessed propane
and butane February CP swaps at
$830/mt and $825/mt, respectively,
Friday, down $102/mt and $92/mt since
the beginning of January. Saudi Aramco's
CPs, which set the price of LPG lifted from
the Saudi Arabian ports of Yanbu, Ras
Tanura and Ju'aymah under long-term sup-
ply contracts, are keenly watched by mar-
ket participants as they tend to set a base
level of pricing for LPG into most markets
east of the Suez. In February 2010,
Aramco had set both its butane and
propane CPs at $735/mt.
Japan's Mitsubishi Apr-Dec net prof-
it soars 93.8% year on year
Japanese trading house Mitsubishi posted
a 93.8% year-on-year surge in net income
for the April-December period, at Yen
359.70 billion ($4.38 billion) on rising
commodity prices, the company said
Monday. Mitsubishi also posted an operat-
ing profit of Yen 266.46 billion in the nine
months to December 31, up 114.3% from
a year ago, while its revenue jumped
15.2% year on year to Yen 14.338 trillion,
the company said. Mitsubishi's energy
business group, which deals with upstream
oil and gas developments and trades
crude oil, refined projects, LPG, LNG and
carbon materials, posted a net profit of
Yen 73.2 billion in the nine-month period,
up 76% from a year ago on rising crude oil
prices, the company said. Mitsubishi's
chemicals group posted a net profit of Yen
21.4 billion for the April-December period,
down 16.7% from a year ago -- reflecting
the absence of a gain on reversal of
deferred tax liabilities of a petrochemical
business-related company in the quarter a
year ago -- despite higher earnings from its
petrochemical business-related company, it
added. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi has main-
tained its income forecast for the fiscal
year ending March 31. Mitsubishi is fore-
cast to post a net profit of Yen 400 billion
on revenue of Yen 19 trillion in fiscal
2010-2011 (April-March).
North Sea mixed butane cargo sold
into petrochemicals sector
A delivered cargo of North Sea mixed
butane has been sold into the petrochemi-
cals sector, according to industry sources.
Norwegian major oil company Statoil con-
firmed at the end of last week selling an
8,600 mt cargo of mixed butane CIF

although the name of the buyer was kept

confidential. Since the beginning of this
year some North Sea normal butane has
been sold into the petrochemicals sector
at CIF prices reported to be close to naph-
tha parity, but mixed butane had been
absorbed into the gasoline related sector
as feedstock for MTBE and alkylate produc-
tion. But with demand from the gasoline
related sector covered in the first two
weeks of February, any surplus North Sea
mixed butane would then have to be sold
into the petrochemicals sector. "People are
well covered up to the middle of the
month," said one source referring to the
lack of gasoline related demand. The
petrochemicals sector does not usually
value mixed butane as highly as normal
butane and would tend to seek lower
prices for the product.
Kearl oil sands project more than
50% complete: Imperial Oil
Imperial Oil's initial development at its
Kearl oil sands project is more than 50%
complete and remains on target for start-
up in late 2012, the company said in its
fourth quarter earnings report Monday.
Initial production at the project, located
near Fort McMurray, Alberta, is expected
at 110,000 b/d, according to the compa-
ny's report. Imperial Oil added it has
begun its 2011 Horn River winter program,
which includes drilling exploration wells
and the development of a horizontal multi-
well pad pilot to evaluate long-term well
productivity. The Horn River play is located
in northwest Alberta and northeast British
Columbia. Also in the report, Imperial Oil
said gross production of Cold Lake bitu-
men averaged 147,000 b/d during the
fourth quarter 2010, up from 134,000
b/d in the same quarter in 2009. The
higher volumes were a result of improved
facility reliability as well as the "cyclic
nature of production at Cold Lake," the
company said. For the year, production of
Cold Lake bitumen increased from
141,000 b/d in 2009 to 144,000 b/d in
2010. Gross production of conventional
crude averaged 24,000 b/d in the fourth
quarter, unchanged from Q4 2009, accord-
ing to the report. For the year, production
averaged 23,000 b/d in 2010, compared
to 25,000 b/d in 2009. Lower production
was attributed to planned maintenance at
the Norman Wells field and natural reser-
voir decline, Imperial Oil said.
Valero says Aruba refinery operating
at planned rates after restart from
early Jan
Valero is currently operating its Aruba refin-
ery at planned rates, company spokesman
Bill Day said Monday, after a restart of the
235,000 b/d refinery began in early
January. "It's been operating at planned
rates since the weekend," Day said. The
Aruba refinery, idled in the summer of 2009
because of poor refining margins, complet-
ed a plantwide turnaround in the middle of
December. The Aruba refinery's output
includes intermediate products for other
refineries and some finished refined prod-
ucts for export to countries besides the US.
Huntsman reports outage at TX
olefins plant; production resuming
The Huntsman Corporation expected its Port
Neches, Texas, olefins plant to resume on-
spec production by end of business day
Monday, a company spokesman said, two
days after the complex suffered an electrical
power failure. The outage, which occured
early Saturday, resulted in flaring and releas-
es of ethylene, propylene and other chemi-
cals into the atmosphere, according to a
company filing with the Texas Commission
on Environmental Quality. The outage inter-
rupted olefins production, Huntsman
spokesman Gary Chapman confirmed.
Huntsman's Port Neches complex has an
ethylene production capacity estimated at
400 million lb/year. In the spot market
Monday, ethylene was talked higher to close
the month, with January ranges at 45-46.50
cents/lb MtB Wms and February at 45.750-
46.50 cents/lb.
Suez Canal operating normally;
shippers wary of delays
Shipping movements through the Suez
Canal are continuing as normal Monday
despite the unrest in Egypt, although a
slowdown may be on cards as some
shipowners are finding it difficult to pay
fees to Egyptian agents, shipping sources
said. "Those ships that have paid their
fees previously are currently moving
through the canal. The fresh applicants
are finding it difficult to make bank remit-
tances," said a shipping agency source at
the city of Suez. The fees for moving ship-
ping through the Suez Canal are paid into
the accounts of the ships agents by
shipowners, who in turn make the pay-
ment to the Suez Canal authority. Oil
traders are keeping a close eye on devel-
opments in Egypt, particularly in the city of
Suez, due to the potential effect on traffic
through the strategic canal. "The concern
is if things become lawless with the loot-
ings which may lead to staff not going to
work at the refineries and the canal," said
a trader from a major oil company. There
were market reports that there were
potentially delays in the Red Sea due to
slower than usual operations at the canal.
"We saw stories about vessels not being
able to get [Suez Canal] security staff on
board. This may lead to delays in the Red
Sea if boats do not get through," a trader
said. The protests against the government
of President Hosni Mubarak, which were
continuing for a seventh day Monday, have
led to many banks being shut, making it
difficult for businesses to carry out cash
transfers. "At the moment we are paying
the Suez Canal fees for our principals
from our own money. We will soon run out
of cash if the situation doesn't improve,"
the shipping agency source said, adding
that there had been long queues at banks
which are open to draw out cash as ATMs
in the city have run out of money. The
Egyptian army and navy are reportedly
supervising the transit of vessels through
the vital sea link that connects the Red
Sea with the Mediterranean Sea, and a
source at the Suez Canal Authority said
the waterway was operating without any
problems. "Everything is OK on the Suez
Canal," the source said. The canal, which
is 120 miles long, is a key sea lane mov-
ing crude and other oil products from the
Middle East and Asia to Europe and vice
versa. An estimated 1 million b/d of crude
and refined products moved north from

the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean Sea
in 2009, while 800,000 b/d moved south-
bound into the Red Sea, according to the
latest figures from the US Energy
Information Administration. Shipping
industry sources said any disruption to
the canal would likely have a big impact
on the market, as it would force tankers
to make the much longer journey around
the Cape of Good Hope. "The canal has
not been closed in more than 35 years so
it is hard to say what will happen [to the
Mediterranean market]," said one source.
Another shipping source, following gaso-
line cargoes heading trans-Atlantic from
Northwest Europe to the US Gulf Coast,
suggested there would be no short-term
impact on this market. "Right now we do
not seem to affected," the source said. "It
should [effect the trans-Atlantic] eventually
as it will have a huge impact on tonnes
per mile." Over 35,000 ships transited
the Suez Canal in 2009, of which 10%
were petroleum tankers, according to the
US Energy Information Administration. As
well as crude oil, the route is commonly
used by tankers carrying jet fuel from the
Middle East to Europe, and traders said
any delays would likely push jet prices
higher. "If we were to lose few cargoes of
jet by going around the Cape of Good
Hope, this will have an impact on prices.
We are already undersupplied by 300,000
mt in Northwest Europe," said one jet
trader. Diverting traffic from the Suez
Canal will add about 12 days to the a typi-
cal journey to Europe, with an additional
12 days for the vessel to go back to its
loading port in the Persian Gulf. This
would likely have a big impact on the avail-
ability of vessels in the market, pushing
up shipping rates.
